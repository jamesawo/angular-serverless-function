# ☁️⚡ Building a Serverless Angular Blog Using Netlify Edge Functions

Welcome to this simple Serverless Angular Blog project! 

This project is a simple blog website built using Angular (for the frontend) and connecting to Netlify Serverless Edge Functions and storing data using MongoDB.

This is a basic project to learn and explore Serverless Architecture.


## Why

Serverless architecture is a way of building and running applications and services without having to manage infrastructure. One interesting thing to me about serverless is its automatic scaling capabilities with the flexibility for a pay-per-use model. 
 
I picked a lot of interest in Serverless Architecture and I wanted to dive deep and start building amazing things, this is that simple project that kicks the can down the road.
